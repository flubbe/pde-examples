# SageMath PDE examples

Two Jupyter notebooks using SageMath and numpy to generate numerical solutions to the 2d heat equation and the 2d Laplace equation.

This is just a quick demonstration for visualization purposes, using forward differences. For better precision and stability, 
one should use different methods.
